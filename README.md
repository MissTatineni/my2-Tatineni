# Bhargavi Tatineni

###### My favorite vacation spot is GoKarna,India.

Gokarna is located in the state of Karnataka, India. It is famous for it's stretch of 5 beaches.
Of all the beaches in Gokarna, **Om beach** is my favorite place to be. It holds *serenity* and makes me feel _rejunevated_ everytime. I have been to Gokarna thrice with my friends. Also, the __beach trek__ covering the five beaches during the monsoon is one of the finest experiences I had.
