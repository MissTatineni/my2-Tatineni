# Bhargavi Tatineni

I am Bhargavi Tatineni. I am from Vijayawada,India. 

My hobbies are *listening to music, exploring new places*. Of all my hobbies, travelling makes me more excited. I have been to many places with my friends. We have covered most of the southern India. I like beaches more however I enjoy mountain views too.
